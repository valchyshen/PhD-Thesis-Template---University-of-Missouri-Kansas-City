Files: 

    *   main.tex    --  this is the main file of the LaTeX project, which
                        puts together all other pieces of the project
    *   tools.tex   --  this file uploads all needed packages, 
                        modifies basic commands, and creates new ones
    *   ref.bib     --  this is the file with bibliography entries (books, 
                        articles, other docs)

Before you start, consider the following steps:

(1) Use file 00-MyInfo.tex to provide your details, such as the author's name, thesis title, department of UMKC, year of defence, supervisory committee, etc.

(2) List all acronyms in the file 00-Acronyms.tex, following the rules for defining an acronym as required by the package `acro`. Next, place all your references into the file ref.bib. Both files contain examples to follow and replicate.

(3) Use file 03-Abstract.tex to locate the text of your abstract. Follow the short instructions inside this file.

(4) Use file 06-Acknowledgments.tex to place the text of your acknowledgments. Follow the short instructions inside this file.

(5) If your work has a Preface, then place its text inside the file: 07-Preface.tex

(6) Your chapter 1 text must be placed into file 11-Chapter1.tex. Then, your chapter 2 goes into file 12-Chapter2.tex. And similarly, your chapter 3 text goes into file 13-Chapter3.tex. If you have more chapters, create new files such as 14-Chapter4.tex, 15-Chapter5.tex.

(7) If you have appendix sections, locate them in the file 20-Appendicies.tex

(8) Use file 21-Vita.tex to place the text of your short CV written as a text.
