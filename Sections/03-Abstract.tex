[The abstract should summarize the problems dealt with by the research, the research methods employed, and the major findings. As a digest of the entire thesis or dissertation, the abstract should be organized to correlate with the thesis or dissertation outline. The same, careful attention given to the writing of the thesis or dissertation should be given to writing the abstract. The purpose of the study, the research methodology, and a summary of the findings should be included. The abstract should not be a mere rewording of the table of contents; and it \textit{should not include footnotes or references}. The abstract must be in English. The text of the abstract must be double-spaced, and it should not exceed 350 words. Do not include the heading, title, or author's name in the word count.]
