This last section of the T/D, VITA, is written in paragraph form, in third person, and is double-spaced. It is a type of biographical sketch, and it is different from a Curriculum Vitae. In the VITA, the date, place of birth, and schools attended are optional, and it is not recommended to include them. The bio should only include professional information, such as degrees previously earned, academic positions held, academic honors, and major research accomplishments or publications
